-> Just look at the code and understand the flow its initial part (pixel to ray is similar to the assignment).
-> initial process of ray casting have already implemeted. (class Ray)
-> render-engine send out the initial rays.
-> transform function takes the points and find cubic spline. using this i have created two transform functions color and alpha (opacity) these can be customized for the user.
-> For volume i have created "class Volume". it read the "volume_file.ctscan" and also compute gradient (also can used the already computed gradient for fast computation).
-> currently do the nearest neighbour only (needs to implement voxel intersection).
-> for rending technique : average has been implemented (X-Ray).
-> first intersection : currently doing ray to axis aligned rectangle rather than ray-AABB.
-> currently using 1D Transfer function. (needs to implement to use gradient for the opacity)
-> you can look at img.png for the currente output.
